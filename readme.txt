IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO MIGRATE TO OTHER MORE MODERN AND BETTER MAINTAINED PLUGINS.

IF YOU ARE STARTING A NEW BLOG, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SEARCH FOR OTHER PLUGINS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE FUTURE MIGRATION.

= Changelog Entries =

Please check out the changelog of each release by following the links below. You can also check the [roadmap](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/roadmap "Add-Headers Roadmap") regarding future releases of the plugin.

- [2.0.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/314)
 - This release introduces the concept of setting a different caching timeout on _old content_. For this reason two new options have been added: [cache_old_content_threshold_seconds](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#cache_old_content_threshold_seconds) and [cache_old_content_max_age_seconds](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#cache_old_content_max_age_seconds). Please see this [configuration example](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration#Different-caching-timeout-for-old-content) that demonstrates this functionality.
 - Minor improvements and fixes.
- [2.0.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/313)
 - IMPORTANT CHANGE OF THE DEFAULT FUNCTIONALITY: Since the v2.0.0 major release, no page is allowed to be cached by default. Caching needs to be enabled by [configuring](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-headers/wiki/Configuration) the plugin.
 - Improved the header generation mechanism. New header array format: `['HEADER_NAME'] => 'HEADER_VALUE'`
 - Added the `remove_pre_existing_headers` option. When enabled, it instructs the plugin to clear any preexisting ETag, Last-Modified, Expires, Cache-Control and Pragma headers before sending its own headers, according to the user defined options.
 - Other minor fixes and improvements.
- [1.2.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/243)
 - Instead of `Pragma: cache`, now sends `Pragma: public`. This is not included in any standard. The `public` value is used by convention.
 - The array that holds the headers just before sending them to the clients now has proper keys for easier header isolation when filtering.
 - Fixed a small bug that happened whenever a taxonomy archive without any posts was visited.
- [1.2.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/242)
 - New option added: `cache_max_age_seconds_for_authenticated_users` initially set to 0 seconds. If you need cached content for authenticated users, adjust this accordingly.
 - The `Pragma` header is now also sent with a value of `no-cache` or `cache` according to *Cache-Control* header's `max-age`.
- [1.1.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/235)
- [1.1.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/217)
 - Bug fix: In 1.1.0 two new filters had been added with wrong prefix in their names. This has been fixed in 1.1.1.
- [1.1.0](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/212)
- [1.0.5](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/211)
- [1.0.4](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/210)
- [1.0.3](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/209)
- [1.0.2](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/208)
- [1.0.1](http://www.codetrax.org/versions/203)
